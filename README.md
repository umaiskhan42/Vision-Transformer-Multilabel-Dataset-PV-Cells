## Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) systems are pivotal in the global shift to renewable energy, but faults can severely reduce their efficiency. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach using Vision Transformers (ViTs) for multi-label classification of PV faults. Experimental results demonstrate that ViTs achieve a detection accuracy of 93.5%, significantly surpassing CNN-based models such as MobileNet and EfficientNet, which scored 90.4% and 90.3%, respectively. The proposed approach provides significant improvements in fault detection, ensuring more efficient and reliable solar energy generation for sustainable power systems.

Our main findings include:

•	This paper implements ViTs for multilabel solar dataset.
•	Improve method for preprocessing and handling multilabel solar PV cell dataset.
•	Comparison of ViTs with traditional CNNs for solar PV cells.
